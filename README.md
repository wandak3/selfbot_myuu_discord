## Main Feature
All the main feature for this selfbot:
- **Playing Myuu for you** (auto route, auto breed, and more..)
- **Connection Free**: you can still run the bot without having to touch your phone or internet connection. Setup - run and do what you want in real life, then comeback and check your box 
for the result
- **Ban risk is almost 0%**: Unless you make use of the bot to spam in Myuu main server or other server, this bot is almost ban free because it works only in your private server.

## How to access to the bot

1. Create a new Discord account (recommended)
2. Send your new created username and password acccount in step 1 to my email account: wandaandita2003@gmail.com. so I can added the account to the system.
3. I will contact you again for a full tutorial of the bot with **10 minutes of trying it for free.**

## Price
The bot is put behind a paywall to prevent mass access from alot of player. This might lead to break the game ecosystem and also, I need income to keep the server up and running!

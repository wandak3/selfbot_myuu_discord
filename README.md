# Myuu Autogrind

**Myuu Autogrind** is a self Discord-bot, meaning it will use your Discord TOKEN to logged into your account and play the commands as if you are playing yourself.

<u>**Disclaimer**:</u> Self-bot is against TOS of Discord. I will not take responsible if your bot get banned by Discord. Use the bot at your own risk!

<u>**Update 2022-10-12**:</u>
1. Due to large number of user using autogrind, to prevent the outrageously number of shinies on the Myuu market, I no longer take new account for auto shiny catcher. 
2. The only bot still runs is **auto breeding (NEW)**. More detail, please check below.
3. I will now take order from discord account: <b>andita#5182</b>

## Breeding Bot [NEW]

- **Breeding shinies for you**: the bot will grab the egg for you, and swap the hatched one into your box automatically!
- **24/7**: bot will always be available to pick up the egg. You can have a night out, get some sleep. Wake up with a box full of Pok√© babies.
- **Ban risk is 0%**: the bot is tested by myself and my alt for 5 months now, no ban, even from Discord. This is the safest self-bot there is because:
	- No spam.
	- No flooded your DM.
	- Only runs when the egg comes.
##### Price for this bot is 5$/month now. Payment through <a>paypal.me/wandaandita2003</a>

## Main Feature [Stop taking orders]
All the main feature for this selfbot:
- **Playing Myuu for you** (auto route, auto breed, and more..)
- **Connection Free**: you can still run the bot without having to touch your phone or internet connection. Setup - run and do what you want in real life, then comeback and check your box 
for the result
- **Ban risk is almost 0%**: Unless you make use of the bot to spam in Myuu main server or other server, this bot is almost ban free because it works only in your private server.

## How to access to the bot

1. Create a new Discord account (recommended)
2. Send your new created username and password acccount in step 1 to my Discord account: **andita#5182** so I can added the account to the system.
3. I will contact you again for a full tutorial of the bot with **10 minutes of trying it for free.**
